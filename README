Build
-----

To build this repository, you will need an up-to-date dports repo
and the additional local repository available at:
http://github.com/avsm/darwinports/

You will need at least:

 * ocaml
 * caml-json-wheel
 * caml-json-static
 * caml-sqlite3
 * caml-ocamlnet
 * caml-uuidm
 * caml-ansicolor

Just do "make" in the current directory to build the sources.

Configuration
-------------

The server gets its base configuration from "config.json" in the build
directory.

 * lifedb_directory: Root of the user's LifeDB files
 * plugins_directory: List of directories to search for plugins
 * log_directory: Directory to drop task logfiles and database to
 * cache_directory: temporary space to hold cache files from plugins
 * test_mode: if true, will not actually run commands but do everything else.

Running
-------

To run the server in the foreground:

# ./lifedb_server -conf netplex.cfg -fg

This is also the "make run" Makefile target.

Databases
---------

Log messages and progress are output to stdout and also to <logging_dir>/log.db

The main LifeDB cache is held in <lifedb_dir>/life.db
